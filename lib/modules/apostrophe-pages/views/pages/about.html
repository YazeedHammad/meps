                    <p>As it strives to increase controls around cardholder data and reduce credit card fraud via its
                        exposure, MEPS became certified in Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) in June

                        information for major debit, credit, prepaid, e-wallet, ATM and POS cards.
    
    
    
                        Additionally, MEPS was an active Participating Organization member of the PCI Security Standards
                        Council (PCI SSC). As the first and only PCI SSC Board of Advisors representative from the Pan-Arab
                        region, MEPS is able to positively contribute to countering cybercrime and to the global PCI
                        security community at large.</p>
